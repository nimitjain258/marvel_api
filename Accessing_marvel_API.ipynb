    "## 5. Making Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "> Types of requests available\n",
    "\n",
    "> Format of attributes within the requests\n",
    "\n",
    "> Examples of each request\n",
    "\n",
    "The A3 API will most likely run on your local port 5000, so the basic url for your requests will be: http://localhost:5000/.\n",
    "Within this URL, you can access the 4 different resources through their different endpoints ('/characters', '/signup', '/login' and '/tokenuptime'), which will allow you to perform different requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic format of any request will be: ``request.[method](url = basicURL/endpoint, params = {})`` where params corresponds to the different parameters that the request should take into account, in a dictionary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Sign Up Endpoint:\n",
    "This endpoint is used to create a new account. The only action available here is a post request, wherby your chosen email and password information for the account will be stored in the API's database to recognize you when you log in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by running the following code on your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "> ``requests.post(\"http://localhost:5000/signup\" , params = {\"email\": \"your@email\", \"password\": \"yourPassword\"})``\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Log In Endpoint:\n",
    "This endpoint is used to log in into your existing user, to be able to manipulate the Characters dataset. The only action available here is a get request, whereby your email and password are checked, and you get an access token as a result, with validity of 1 hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by running the following code on your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "> ``requests.get(\"http://localhost:5000/login\" , params = {\"email\": \"your@email\", \"password\": \"yourPassword\"})``\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Token Up Time Endpoint:\n",
    "This endpoint can be used to check the remaining uptime of your access token. The only action available here is a get request, whereby the validity of the access token that you provide is checked. You will get as a result the remaining valid time that the token has left, and once this time expires, you will be logged out of the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by running the following code on your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "> ``requests.get(\"http://localhost:5000/tokenuptime\" , headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer\" + \"yourToken\"})``\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Characters Endpoint:\n",
    "Within the Characters Resource, you will be able to make:\n",
    "- Get request: to retrieve data of Characters from the Dataset\n",
    "- Post request: to add data of new Marvel Characters to the Dataset\n",
    "- Delete request: to eliminate data on existing Characters from the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Get Method:\n",
    "This method allows you to retrieve information on one or multiple Marvel characters of your choice from the Dataset using either the character's id or name. However, using both identifiers simultaneously is prohibited.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by running the following code on your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "> ``requests.get(\"http://localhost:5000/characters\" , params = {\"character_name\": [\"Abyss\", \"3-D Man\"]})``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Post Method:\n",
    "This method allows you to add one Marvel character of your choice to the Dataset. In order to do so, you must indicate the character id as parameter of the request. Other character attributes may also be included in the request's parameters, but are not necessary. On the other hand, you must indicate your access token as header in order to execute this request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by running the following code on your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "> ``requests.post(\"http://localhost:5000/characters\" , params = {\"character_id\": \"1009151\"}, headers ={\"Authorization\": \"Bearer\"+\"yourToken\"})``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Put Method:\n",
    "This method allows you to modify the price of one or multiple characters contained in the Dataset. In order to do so, you must indicate as parameters either the character(s) name(s) or id(s), as well as the desired new price(s) and currency(ies). In order to carry out this request, you are obligated to provide your access token as header as well .  \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by running the following code on your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "> ``requests.put(\"http://localhost:5000/characters\" , params = {\"character_id\": [\"1017851\",\"1011031\"], \"new_price\":[\"3.99\", \"9.99\"], \"currency\":[\"USD\",\"USD\"]}, headers ={\"Authorization\": \"Bearer\"+\"yourToken\"})``\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Delete Method:\n",
    "This method allows you to delete one or multiple entries from the Dataset. In order to do so, all that is required is that you indicate either the id(s) or the name(s) of the character(s) you wish to remove in the parameters of your request, in addition to your given access token as header. Please note that if you use both character id and character name identifiers simultaneously, fail to indicate any parameters, or fail to indicate a header containing your access token, your request will return an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by running the following code on your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "> ``requests.delete(\"http://localhost:5000/characters\" , params = {\"character_name\": [\"Agent Brand\", \"Adam Warlock\"]}, headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer\" + \"yourToken\"}})``\n"

    "## 6. Results\n",
    "The A3 API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the range 2xx indicate success, while codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common results you will get are:\n",
    "- **200:** indicates that your request was successful\n",
    "- **400:** indicates that you omitted a required parameter to perform the request or that you are giving two substitutory parameters at the same time\n",
    "- **401:** when trying to log in, indicates you are using the wrong email or password\n",
    "- **404:** indicates you are trying to interact with a Character that doesn't exist\n",
    "- **409:** indicates you are trying to add a resource (Character or email when signing up) that already exists"
